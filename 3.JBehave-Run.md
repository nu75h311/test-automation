- [Run test](#run-test)

## Create story
### Stories folder
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the `src/main/resources` folder > New > Other.
2.	Select General > Folder from the list; click Next.
3.	Fill the Folder Name as *stories*; click Finish.

### Math.story
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the *stories* folder > New > File.
2.	Fill the File Name as `Math.story`; click Finish.
3.	The new `Math.story` is created; should contain some test scenarios.

Check the content [here][Math.story].


## Create steps
### Steps package
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the `src/main/java` folder > New > Package.
2.	Fill the Name as *com.wipro.testing.training.steps*; click Finish.

### MathSteps.java
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the *com.wipro.testing.training.steps* package > New > Class.
2.	Fill the Name as `MathSteps`; click Finish.
3.	The new `MathSteps.java` is created; should contain:
    - Extends Steps (import from org.jbehave.core.steps).
    - Declaration of `int x`.
    - Public `@Given` step to get the first value.
    - Public `@When` step to multiply the first value with a second value.
    - Public `@Then` step to validate the expected result.  

Check the code [here][MathSteps.java].


## Create runner

### Stories package
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the `src/main/java` folder > New > Package.
2.	Fill the Name as *com.wipro.testing.training.stories*; click Finish.

### JBehaveRunner.java
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the *com.wipro.testing.training.stories* package > New > Class.
2.	Fill the Name as `JBehaveRunner`; click Finish.
3.	The new `JBehaveRunner.java` is created; should contain:
    - `Private static Embedder` declaration.
    - `Private static List<String>` declaration of `storyPaths` mapping the `Math.story` file.
    - `Public main` method that:
        - Adds the `MathSteps` steps to the embedder.
        - Runs the stories from the `storyPaths` list.

        
Check the code [here][JBehaveRunner.java].


## Run test
1.	In the Project Explorer pane, right click the `JBehaveRunner.java` class > Run As > Java Application.
2.	The application should run: the Console will show the application was run with no errors.
3.	You can force an error by changing the expected result in the `Math.story` file.


## Proposed exercise
Add more scenarios to the story file, making one for division, one for addition and one for subtraction. For these to run, they will require adding new steps to the `MathSteps.java` file.
